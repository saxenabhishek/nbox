"""
Jupyter Notebooks are user by millions of developers world wide, so we said why not just
create an operator that runs the jupyter notebook and creates a python file out of it.
Catch: Currently we do not support notebooks that have a `!` for shell commands, please
replace them with `subprocess.call(shelex.split(<com>))`

  # Jupyter has support for built in shell commands by adding a ! like this

  # python values by adding a $ in front of the variable name

  # perform a modifications to the code before we parse it
  # remember this can also be in multiple lines by adding \ at the end
  #
  # this is a very hard problem to solve because of the number of edge cases
  # if there is a ! inside triple quotes, then it cannot be updated
  # however it is very hard to determine the triple quoted strings without
  # running the code. the chicken and egg problem
  # so for now we are saying if you have that kindly remove it.

  # jupyter notebook also has support for magic commands through % and %% like
  # %matplotlib inline
