"""
Though initially this code just like the `on_ml.py`
code was build separately for each different package that we supported and that
led to just some really duct taping and hacking around that made it inefficient
to scale. The lesson is that premature attempts to scale are as bad as not being
able to scale. On that end eventually this file will be broken apart by packages
but hopefully it is in a way better. My depth limit = 2.

Read the code for best understanding.
